Discovered in 1937 by C.W. Andersonand S.H. Neddermeyer when they exposed a cloud chamber to cosmic rays,its finite lifetime was first demonstrated in 1941 by F. Rasetti. Theinstrument described in this manual permits you to measure the chargeaveraged mean muon lifetime in plastic scintillator, to measure therelative flux of muons as a function of height above sea-level and todemonstrate the time dilation effect of special relativity. Theinstrument also provides a source of genuinely random numbers that canbe used for experimental tests of standard probability distributions.\section{The Muon Source}The top of earth's atmosphere is bombarded by a flux of high energycharged particles produced in other parts of the universe bymechanisms that are not yet fully understood. The composition of these"primary cosmic rays" is somewhat energy dependent but a usefulapproximation is that 98\% of these particles are protons or heaviernuclei and 2\% are electrons. Of the protons and nuclei, about 87\%are protons, 12\% helium nuclei and the balance are still heaviernuclei that are the end products of stellar nucleosynthesis. SeeSimpson in the reference section for more details. The primary cosmic rays collide with the nuclei of air molecules andproduce a shower of particles that include protons, neutrons, pions(both charged and neutral), kaons, photons, electrons and positrons.These secondary particles then undergo electromagnetic and nuclearinteractions to produce yet additional particles in a cascade process.Figure \ref{FigShower} indicates the general idea. Of particularinterest is the fate of the charged pions produced in the cascade.Some of these will interact via the strong force with air moleculenuclei but others will spontaneously decay (indicated by the arrow)via the weak force into a muon plus a neutrino or antineutrino:\begin{eqnarray*}   \pi^{+} & \rightarrow & \mu^{+}\nu_{mu}  \\   \pi^{-} & \rightarrow & \mu^{-}\bar{\nu}_{\mu}\end{eqnarray*}The muon does not interact with matter via the strong force but onlythrough the weak and electromagnetic forces. It travels a relativelylong instance while losing its kinetic energy and decays by the weakforce into an electron plus a neutrino and antineutrino. We willdetect the decays of some of the muons produced in the cascade. (Ourdetection efficiency for the neutrinos and antineutrinos is utterlynegligible.)\begin{figure}[tbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[height=4in]{MuonLifetime/shower}   \caption{ Cosmic ray cascade induced by a cosmic ray proton striking   an air molecule nucleus.}   \label{FigShower}\end{figure}Not all of the particles produced in the cascade in the upperatmosphere survive down to sea-level due to their interaction withatmospheric nuclei and their own spontaneous decay. The flux ofsea-level muons is approximately 1 per minute per cm2 (seehttp://pdg.lbl.gov for more precise numbers) with a mean kineticenergy of about 4 GeV. Careful study [http://pdg.lbl.gov] shows that the mean productionheight in the atmosphere of the muons detected at sea-level isapproximately 15 km. Travelling at the speed of light, the transittime from production point to sea-level is then 50 $\mu$sec. Since thelifetime of at-rest muons is more than a factor of 20 smaller, theappearance of an appreciable sea- level muon flux is qualitativeevidence for the time dilation effect of special relativity.\section{Muon Decay Time Distribution}The decay times for muons are easily described mathematically. Supposeat some time $t$ we have $N(t)$ muons. If the probability that a muondecays in some small time interval $dt$ is $\lambda \,dt$, where$\lambda$ is a constant \emph{decay rate} that characterizes howrapidly a muon decays, then the change $dN$ in our population of muonsis just $dN = -N(t) \,\lambda \,dt$, or $dN/N(t) = -\lambda \,dt$.Integrating, we have $N(t) = N_{0} \,e^{-\lambda t}$, where $N(t)$ isthe number of surviving muons at some time $t$ and $N0$ is the numberof muons at $t = 0$. The \emph{lifetime} $\tau$ of a muon is thereciprocal of $\lambda$, $\tau = 1/\lambda$. This simple exponentialrelation is typical of radioactive decay. Now, we do not have a single clump of muons whose surviving number wecan easily measure. Instead, we detect muon decays from muons thatenter our detector at essentially random times, typically one at atime. It is still the case that their decay time distribution has asimple exponential form of the type described above. By decay timedistribution $D(t)$, we mean that the time-dependent probability thata muon decays in the time interval between $t$ and $t + \,dt$ is givenby $D(t) \,dt$. If we had started with $N_{0}$ muons, then the fraction$-dN/N_{0}$ that would on average decay in the time interval between$t$ and $t + \,dt$ is just given by differentiating the above relation:\begin{eqnarray*}   -dN & = & N_{0} \,\lambda \,e^{\lambda t}\,dt  \\   -dN/N_{0} & = & \lambda\,e^{-\lambda t}\,dt\end{eqnarray*}The left-hand side of the last equation is nothing more than the decayprobability we seek, so $D(t) = \lambda \, e^{-\lambda t}$. This istrue regardless of the starting value of $N_{0}$. That is, thedistribution of decay times, for new muons entering our detector, isalso exponential with the very same exponent used to describe thesurviving population of muons. Again, what we call the muon lifetimeis $\tau = 1/\lambda$. Because the muon decay time is exponentially distributed, it does notmatter that the muons whose decays we detect are not born in thedetector but somewhere above us in the atmosphere. An exponentialfunction always \emph{looks the same} in the sense that whether youexamine it at early times or late times, its e-folding time (time todecrease by a factor $e$) is the same.\section{Detector Physics}The active volume of the detector is a plastic scintillator in theshape of a right circular cylinder of 15 cm diameter and 12.5 cmheight placed at the bottom of the black anodized aluminum alloy tube.Plastic scintillator is transparent organic material made by mixingtogether one or more fluors with a solid plastic solvent that has anaromatic ring structure. A charged particle passing through thescintillator will lose some of its kinetic energy by ionization andatomic excitation of the solvent molecules. Some of this depositedenergy is then transferred to the fluor molecules whose electrons arethen promoted to excited states. Upon radiative de-excitation, lightin the blue and near-UV portion of the electromagnetic spectrum isemitted with a typical decay time of a few nanoseconds. A typicalphoton yield for a plastic scintillator is 1 optical photon emittedper 100 eV of deposited energy. The properties of thepolyvinyltoluene-based scintillator used in the muon lifetimeinstrument are summarized in table \ref{TblScintProps}. To measure the muon's lifetime, we are interested in only those muonsthat enter, slow, stop and then decay inside the plastic scintillator.Figure \ref{FigSchematic} summarizes this process. Such muons have atotal energy of only about 160 MeV as they enter the tube. As a muonslows to a stop, the excited scintillator emits light that is detectedby a photomultiplier tube (PMT), eventually producing a logic signalthat triggers a timing clock. (See the electronics section below formore detail.) A stopped muon, after a bit, decays into an electron, aneutrino and an anti-neutrino. (See the next section for an importantqualification of this statement.) Since the electron mass is so muchsmaller that the muon mass, $m_{\mu}/m_{e} \sim 210$, the electrontends to be very energetic and to produce scintillator lightessentially all along its pathlength. The neutrino and anti-neutrinoalso share some of the muon's total energy but they entirely escapedetection. This second burst of scintillator light is also seen by thePMT and used to trigger the timing clock. The distribution of timeintervals between successive clock triggers for a set of muon decaysis the physically interesting quantity used to measure the muonlifetime.\begin{figure}[tbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[height=3in]{MuonLifetime/ScintillatorSchematic}   \caption{Schematic showing the generation of the two light pulses(short arrows) used in determining the muon lifetime. One light pulseis from the slowing muon (dotted line) and the other is from its decayinto an electron or positron (wavey line).}   \label{FigSchematic}\end{figure}\begin{table}[tbp]   \centering   \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}      \hline      Mass Density &  1.032 g/cm3 \\      \hline      Refractive index & 1.58  \\      \hline      Base material &  Polyvinyltoluene \\      \hline      Rise time &   0.9 ns \\      \hline      Fall time &  2.4 ns   \\      \hline      $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$ & 423 nm  \\      \hline   \end{tabular}   \caption{ General Scintillator Properties}    \label{TblScintProps}\end{table}\section{Interaction of $\mu^{-}$'s with Matter}The muons whose lifetime we measure necessarily interact with matter.Negative muons that stop in the scintillator can bind to thescintillator's carbon and hydrogen nuclei in much the same way aselectrons do. Since the muon is not an electron, the Pauli exclusionprinciple does not prevent it from occupying an atomic orbital alreadyfilled with electrons. Such bound negative muons can then interactwith protons\[   \mathrm{\mu^{-} + p \rightarrow n + \nu_{\mu}}\] before they spontaneously decay. Since there are now two ways for anegative muon to disappear, the effective lifetime of negative muonsin matter is somewhat less than the lifetime of positively chargedmuons, which do not have this second interaction mechanism.Experimental evidence for this effect is shown in figure\ref{FigDisintegration} where \emph{disintegration} curves forpositive and negative muons in aluminum are shown. (See Rossi, 1952)The abscissa is the time interval $t$ between the arrival of a muon inthe aluminum target and its decay. The ordinate, plottedlogarithmically, is the number of muons greater than the correspondingabscissa. These curves have the same meaning as curves representingthe survival population of radioactive substances. The slope of thecurve is a measure of the effective lifetime of the decayingsubstance. The muon lifetime we measure with this instrument is anaverage over both charge species so the mean lifetime of the detectedmuons will be somewhat less than the free space value $\tau = 2.19703\pm 0.00004 \mu\mathrm{sec}$. \begin{figure}[tbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[height=5in]{MuonLifetime/Disintegration}   \caption{Disintegration curves for positive and negative muons in aluminum. The ordinates at $t = 0$ can be used to determine the relative numbers of negative and positive muons that have undergone spontaneous decay. The slopes can be used to determine the decay time of each charge species. (From Rossi, p168.) }   \label{FigDisintegration}\end{figure}The probability for nuclear absorption of a stopped negative muon byone of the scintillator nuclei is proportional to $Z^{4}$, where $Z$ is theatomic number of the nucleus [Rossi, 1952]. A stopped muon captured inan atomic orbital will make transitions down to the K-shell on a timescale short compared to its time for spontaneous decay [Wheeler]. ItsBohr radius is roughly 200 times smaller than that for an electron dueto its much larger mass, increasing its probability for being found inthe nucleus. From our knowledge of hydrogenic wavefunctions, theprobability density for the bound muon to be found inside the nucleusis proportional to $Z^{3}$. Once inside the nucleus, a muon’s probabilityfor encountering a proton is proportional to the number of protonsthere and so scales like $Z$. The net effect is for the overallabsorption probability to scale like $Z^{4}$. Again, this effect isrelevant only for negatively charged muons.\section{$\mu^{+}/\mu^{-}$ Charge Ratio at Ground Level}Our measurement of the muon lifetime in plastic scintillator is anaverage over both negatively and positively charged muons. We havealready seen that $\mu^{-}$’s have a lifetime somewhat smaller thanpositively charged muons because of weak interactions between negativemuons and protons in the scintillator nuclei. This interactionprobability is proportional to $Z^{4}$, where $Z$ is the atomic numberof the nuclei, so the lifetime of negative muons in scintillator andcarbon should be very nearly equal. This latter lifetime$\tau_{\mathrm{C}}$ is measured to be $\tau_{\mathrm{C}} = 2.043 ±0.003 \mu\mathrm{sec}$. [Reiter, 1960] It is easy to determine the expected average lifetime$\tau_{\mathrm{obs}}$ of positive and negative muons in plasticscintillator. Let $\lambda^{-}$ be the decay rate per negative muon in plasticscintillator and let $\lambda^{+}$ be the corresponding quantity for positivelycharged muons. If we then let $N^{-}$ and $N^{+}$ represent the number ofnegative and positive muons incident on the scintillator per unittime, respectively, the observed average decay rate $\lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}$ % $\langle \lambda \rangle$ is given by\begin{eqnarray*}   \lambda_{\mathrm{obs}} & = &    \frac{N^{+}\lambda^{+}+N^{-}\lambda^{-}}{N^{+}+N^{-}}  \\   & = & \frac{\rho \lambda^{+} + \lambda^{-}}{1+\rho}\end{eqnarray*}where $\rho \equiv N^{+}/N^{-}$ is the ratio of positive muons tonegative muons. We can define the lifetime of negative muons on thescintillator as $\tau^{-} \equiv 1/\lambda^{-}$ and the lifetime ofpositive muons as $\tau^{+} \equiv 1/\lambda^{+}$. Then the observedaverage lifetime $\tau_{\mathrm{obs}}$ is given by\begin{eqnarray*}   \tau_{\mathrm{obs}} & = & \lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}^{-1}  \\    & = & \frac{1+\rho}{\rho \lambda^{+} + \lambda^{-}}  \\    & = & (1+\rho) (\frac{1}{\tau^{-}} + \frac{\rho}{\tau^{+}})^{-1}  \\    & = & (1+\rho) \frac{\tau^{-} \, \tau^{+}}{\tau^{+} + \rho \tau^{-}}\end{eqnarray*}The lifetime of negative muons in plastic scintillator isapproximately the same as the lifetime in carbon,$\tau^{-}=\tau_{\mathrm{C}}$. On the other hand, positive muons arenot captured by the scintillator nuclei. Therefore the lifetime ofpositive muons, $\tau^{+}$, is equal to the lifetime of muons in freespace, $\tau_{\mu}$. Setting $\rho=1$ allows us to estimate theaverage muon lifetime we expect to observe in the scintillator.We can \emph{measure} $\rho$ for the momentum range of muons that stopin the scintillator by rearranging the above equation:\[\rho = -\frac{\tau^{+}}{\tau^{-}} (\frac{\tau^{-} - \tau_{\mathrm{obs}}}{\tau^{+} - \tau_{\mathrm{obs}}})\]\section{Backgrounds}The detector responds to any particle that produces enoughscintillation light to trigger its readout electronics. Theseparticles can be either charged, like electrons or muons, or neutral,like photons, that produce charged particles when they interact insidethe scintillator. Now, the detector has no knowledge of whether apenetrating particle stops or not inside the scintillator and so hasno way of distinguishing between light produced by muons that stop anddecay inside the detector, from light produced by a pair ofthrough-going muons that occur one right after the other. Thisimportant source of background events can be dealt with in two ways.First, we can restrict the time interval during which we look for thetwo successive flashes of scintillator light characteristic of muondecay events. Secondly, we can estimate the background level bylooking at large times in the decay time histogram where we expect fewevents from genuine muon decay.\section{Fermi Coupling Constant $\mathrm{G_F}$}Muons decay via the weak force and the Fermi coupling constant$\mathrm{G_F}$ is a measure of the strength of the weak force. To agood approximation, the relationship between the muon lifetime $\tau$and $\mathrm{G_F}$ is particularly simple:\[   \tau = \frac{192\,\pi^{3}\,\hbar^{7}}{    \mathrm{G_F}^{2}\,m^{5}\,c^{4}}\]where $m$ is the mass of the muon and the other symbols have theirstandard meanings. Measuring $\tau$ with this instrument and thentaking $m$ from, say, the Particle Data Group (http://www.pdg.lbl.gov)produces a value for $\mathrm{G_F}$.\section{Time Dilation Effect}A measurement of the muon stopping rate at two different altitudes canbe used to demonstrate the time dilation effect of special relativity.Although the detector configuration is not optimal for demonstratingtime dilation, a useful measurement can still be preformed withoutadditional scintillators or lead absorbers. Due to the finite size ofthe detector, only muons with a typical total energy of about 160 MeVwill stop inside the plastic scintillator. The stopping rate ismeasured from the total number of observed muon decays recorded by theinstrument in some time interval. This rate in turn is proportional tothe flux of muons with total energy of about 160 MeV and this fluxdecreases with diminishing altitude as the muons descend and decay inthe atmosphere. After measuring the muon stopping rate at onealtitude, predictions for the stopping rate at another altitude can bemade with and without accounting for the time dilation effect ofspecial relativity. A second measurement at the new altitudedistinguishes between competing predictions. A comparison of the muon stopping rate at two different altitudesshould account for the muon’s energy loss as it descends into theatmosphere, variations with energy in the shape of the muon energyspectrum, and the varying zenith angles of the muons that stop in thedetector. Since the detector stops only low energy muons, the stoppedmuons detected by the low altitude detector will, at the elevation ofthe higher altitude detector, necessarily have greater energy. Thisenergy difference ∆E(h) will clearly depend on the pathlength betweenthe two detector positions. Vertically travelling muons at the position of the higher altitudedetector that are ultimately detected by the lower detector have anenergy larger than those stopped and detected by the upper detector byan amount equal to ∆E(h). If the shape of the muon energy spectrumchanges significantly with energy, then the relative muon stoppingrates at the two different altitudes will reflect this difference inspectrum shape at the two different energies. (This is easy to see ifyou suppose muons do not decay at all.) This variation in the spectrumshape can be corrected for by calibrating the detector in a mannerdescribed below. Like all charged particles, a muon loses energy through coulombicinteractions with the matter it traverses. The average energy lossrate in matter for singly charged particles traveling close to thespeed of light is approximately 2 MeV/g/cm$^{2}$, where we measure thethickness $s$ of the matter in units of g/cm$^{2}$. Here, $s = \rho\,x$, where $\rho$ isthe mass density of the material through which the particle ispassing, measured in g/cm3, and  $x$ is the particle’s pathlength,measured in cm. (This way of measuring material thickness in units ofg/cm$^{2}$ allows us to compare effective thicknesses of two materials thatmight have very different mass densities.) A more accurate value forenergy loss can be determined from the Bethe-Bloch equation.\begin{eqnarray*}   \frac{dE}{dx} & = &    -\frac{4\pi\,N_{\mathrm{e}}^{4}}{mc^{2}\,\beta^{2}} z^{2}\,    \left(\ln\frac{2\,mc^{2}\beta^{2}\gamma^{2}}{I} - \beta^{2}\right) \\    & = & 0.3071\,\left(\mathrm{\frac{MeV}{g/cm^{2}}}\right) \, \frac{Z}{A}\,     \rho\, \frac{1}{\beta^{2}}\, z^{2}\,     \left(\ln\frac{2\,mc^{2}\beta^{2}\gamma^{2}}{I} - \beta^{2}\right)\end{eqnarray*}Here $N$ is the number of electrons in the stopping medium percm$^{3}$, $e$ is the electronic charge, $z$ is the atomic number ofthe projectile, $Z$ and $A$ are the atomic number and weight,respectively, of the stopping medium. The projectile has a velocity,$\beta$, expressed in units of the speed of light, $c$. Itscorresponding Lorentz factor is $\gamma$. The mean excitation energyof the stopping medium atoms, $I$, can be approximates as $I \approxAZ$, where $A \cong 13$ eV. More accurate values for $I$, as well ascorrections to the Bethe-Bloch equation, can be found in [Leo, p26]. A simple estimate of the energy lost, $\Delta E$, by a muon as it travels avertical distance $H$ is \[\Delta E = 2 H \rho_{\mathrm{air}} \mathrm{\frac{MeV}{gm/cm^{2}}} \]where $\rho_{\mathrm{air}}$ is the density of air, possibly averagedover $H$ using the density of air according to the \emph{standardatmosphere}. The atmosphere is assumed to be isothermal and thereduced air pressure $p = P/g$ at some height $h$ above sea level isgiven by $p = p_{0} e^{-h/h_{0}}$, where $p_{0} = 1030\,\mathrm{g/cm^{2}}$ is the total thickness of the atmosphere and $h_{0}= 8.4$ km. The units of reduced pressure are g/cm$^{2}$, which you cansee if you recall from hydrostatics that the pressure at the base of astationary fluid is $P = \rho g h$. Thus the reduced pressure, $p\equiv P/g = \rho h$ will have units of $\mathrm{g/cm^{2}}$. Then theair density $\rho$, in familiar units of g/cm$^{3}$, can be expressed as $\rho = -dp/dh$. In the lab frame, we let $t$ denote the transit time for a particle totravel vertically from some height $H$ down to sea level.  In the rest frame of the particle, the corresponding time, $t^{\prime}$, is given by\[t^{\prime}=\int^{0}_{H}\frac{dh}{c\,\beta(h)\gamma(h)}\]Here $\beta$ and $\gamma$ have their usual relativistic meanings forthe projectile and are measured in the lab frame. Since relativisticmuons lose energy at essentially a constant rate when travellingthrough a medium of mass density $\rho$, $dE/ds = C_{0}$, so we have$dE = \rho C_{0} dh$, with $C_{0} = 2$ MeV/(g/cm$^{2}$). Also, fromthe Einstein relation, $E = \gamma mc^{2}$, $dE = mc^{2} d\gamma$, so$dh = (mc^{2}/\rho C_{0}) d\gamma$. Hence,\begin{eqnarray*}   t^{\prime} & = & \frac{mc}{\rho C_{0}}    \int^{\gamma_{2}}_{\gamma_{1}}\frac{d\gamma}{\beta \gamma}  \\    & = & \frac{mc}{\rho C_{0}}     \int^{\gamma_{2}}_{\gamma_{1}}\frac{d\gamma}{\sqrt{\gamma^{2}-1}}\end{eqnarray*}Here $\gamma_{1}$ is the muon’s gamma factor at height $H$ and$\gamma_{2}$ is its gamma factor just before it enters thescintillator. We can take $\gamma_{2} = 1.5$ since we want muons thatstop in the scintillator and assume that on average stopped muonstravel halfway into the scintillator, corresponding to a distance $s =10\, \mathrm{g/cm^{2}}$. The entrance muon momentum is then taken fromrange-momentum graphs at the Particle Data Group WWW site and thecorresponding $\gamma_{2}$ computed. The lower limit of integration isgiven by $\gamma_{1} = E_{1}/mc^{2}$, where $E_{1} = E_{2} + \DeltaE$, with $E_{2} = 160$ MeV. The integral can be evaluated numerically.(See, for example,http://people.hofstra.edu/faculty/Stefan\_Waner/RealWorld/integral/integral.html) \begin{figure}[tbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[height=4in]{MuonLifetime/MuonMomentum}   \caption{Muon momentum spectrum at sea level. The curves are fits    to various data sets. Figure from Greider, p399.}%    (shown as geometric shapes). Figure is taken from reference [Greider, p399].   \label{FigMuonMomentum}\end{figure}Hence, the ratio $R$ of muon stopping rates for the same detector attwo different positions separated by a vertical distance $H$, andignoring for the moment any variations in the shape of the energyspectrum of muons, is just $R = e^{-t^{\prime}/\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the muonproper lifetime. When comparing the muon stopping rates for the detector at twodifferent elevations, we must remember that muons that stop in thelower detector have, at the position of the upper detector, a largerenergy. If, say, the relative muon abundance grows dramatically withenergy, then we would expect a relatively large stopping rate at thelower detector simply because the starting flux at the position of theupper detector was so large, and not because of any relativisticeffects. Indeed, the muon momentum spectrum does peak, at around $p =500$ MeV/c or so, although the precise shape is not known with highaccuracy. See figure \ref{FigMuonMomentum}.We therefore need a way to correct for variations in the shape of themuon energy spectrum in the region from about 160 -- 800 MeV.(Corresponding to momentum range $p = 120$ -- 790 MeV/c.) We do thisby first measuring the muon stopping rate at two different elevations($\Delta h = 3008$ meters between Taos, NM and Dallas, TX) and thencomputing the ratio $R_{\mathrm{raw}}$ of raw stopping rates.($R_{\mathrm{raw}} = \mathrm{Dallas/Taos} = 0.41 \pm 0.05$) Next,using the above expression for the transit time between the twoelevations, we compute the transit time in the muon’s rest frame($t^{\prime} = 1.32\tau$) for vertically travelling muons andcalculate the corresponding theoretical stopping rate ratio $R =e^{-t^{\prime}/\tau} = 0.267$. We then compute the double ratio $R_{0}= R_{\mathrm{raw}}/R = 1.5 \pm 0.2$ of the measured stopping rateratio to this theoretical rate ratio and interpret this as acorrection factor to account for the increase in muon flux betweenabout E =160 MeV and E = 600 MeV. This correction is to be used in allsubsequent measurements for any pair of elevations. To verify that the correction scheme works, we take a new stoppingrate measurement at a different elevation ($h = 2133$ meters a.s.l. atLos Alamos, NM), and compare a new stopping rate ratio measurementwith our new, corrected theoretical prediction for the stopping rateratio $R_{\mu} = R_{0} R = 1.6 e^{-t^{\prime}/\tau}$. We find$t^{\prime} = 1.06 \tau$ and $R_{\mu} = 0.52 \pm 0.06$. The rawmeasurements yield $R_{\mathrm{raw}} = 0.56 \pm 0.01$, showing good agreement. For your own time dilation experiment, you could first measure the rawmuon stopping rate at an upper and lower elevation. Accounting forenergy loss between the two elevations, you first calculate thetransit time $t^{\prime}$ in the muon’s rest frame and then ana\"{i}ve theoretical lower elevation stopping rate. This na\"{i}ve rateshould then be multiplied by the muon spectrum correction factor $1.5\pm 0.2$ before comparing it to the measured rate at the lowerelevation. Alternatively, you could measure the lower elevationstopping rate, divide by the correction factor, and then account forenergy loss before predicting what the upper elevation stopping rateshould be. You would then compare your prediction against ameasurement.\section{Electronics}\begin{figure}[tbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[width=5in]{MuonLifetime/Electronics}   \caption{Block diagram of the readout electronics. The amplifier and    discriminator outputs are available on the front panel of the electronics    box. The HV supply is inside the detector tube. }   \label{FigElectronics}\end{figure}A block diagram of the readout electronics is shown in figure\ref{FigElectronics}. The logic of the signal processing is simple.Scintillation light is detected by a photomultiplier tube (PMT) whoseoutput signal feeds a two-stage amplifier. The output from theamplifier is then input into a voltage discriminator with anadjustable threshold. If the input signal is above the discriminatorthreshold, then the discriminator outputs a TTL (5 V) logic pulse thattriggers the timing circuit of the FPGA. If, within a fixed timeinterval, the FPGA receives a second TTL pulse, then the timingcircuit will stop. The time interval between the start and stop timingpulses is temprarily stored in a data buffer and then the timingcircuit is reset. (The reset takes about 1 msec during which thedetector is disabled.) The data stored in the buffer is sent to the PCvia the communications module. This data is used to determine the muonlifetime. If a second TTL pulse does not arrive within the fixed timeinterval, the timing circuit stores the value of this time interval inthe data buffer and then automatically resets the circuit for the nextmeasurement. \begin{figure}[tbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{MuonLifetime/PhotoFrontBox}   \caption{Front of the electronics box.}   \label{FigPhotoFrontBox}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[tbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{MuonLifetime/PhotoRearBox}\caption{Rear of electronics box.

An extra fuse is stored inside the powerswitch.The front panel of the electronics box is shown in figure\ref{FigPhotoFrontBox}. The amplifier output is accessible via the BNCconnector labeled \emph{Amplifier output}. Similarly, thediscriminator output is accessible via the connector labeled\emph{Discriminator output}. The voltage level against which theamplifier output is compared to determine whether the discriminatortriggers can be adjusted using the \emph{Threshold control} knob. Thethreshold voltage is monitored by using the red and black connectorsthat accept standard multimeter probe leads. The toggle switchcontrols a beeper that sounds when an amplifier signal is above thediscriminator threshold. The beeper can be turned off.Figure \ref{FigPhotoDetectorTop} shows the top of the detectorcylinder. DC power to the electronics inside the detector tube issupplied from the electronics box through the connector \emph{DC Power}. Thehigh voltage (HV) to the PMT can be adjusted by turning thepotentiometer located at the top of the detector tube. The HV levelcan be measured by using the pair of red and black connectors thataccept standard multimeter probes. The HV monitor output is 1/100times the HV applied to the PMT.A pulser inside the detector tube can drive a light emitting diode(LED) imbedded in the scintillator. It is turned on by the toggleswitch at the tube top. The pulser produces pulse pairs at a fixedrepetition rate of 100 Hz while the time between the two pulsescomprising a pair is adjusted by the knob labeled \emph{Time Adj}. The pulseroutput voltage is accessible at the connector labeled \emph{Pulse Output}.\begin{figure}[tbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[width=4in]{MuonLifetime/PMTOutput}\caption{Output pulse directly from PMT into a $50\, \Omega$ load.Horizontal scale is 20 ns/div and vertical scale is 100 mV/div.}   \label{FigPMTOutput}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[tbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[width=4in]{MuonLifetime/AmpOutput}\caption{Amplifier output pulse from the input signal from figure\ref{FigPMTOutput} and the resulting discriminator output pulse.Horizontal scale is 20 ns/div and the vertical scale is 100 mV/div(amplifier output) and 200 mV/div (discriminator output). }   \label{FigAmpOutput}\end{figure} For reference, figure \ref{FigPMTOutput} shows the output directlyfrom the PMT into a $50\, \Omega$ load. Figure \ref{FigAmpOutput} showsthe corresponding amplifier and discriminator output pulses. \section{Data Acquisition} To acquire the data, you will use the program \emph{Muon}. A link tothe program can be found on the desktop of the computer located on thelab table. This program is rather basic. It collects the data,validates it, and saves it to a file.  \emph{Muon} can provide an initial estimate of the time constant (muon lifetime) of the collected data.  However, to perform a proper calculation of the lifetime and its uncertainty, you will need to analyze the data in MatLab.  \begin{figure}[tbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[width=4in]{MuonLifetime/MuonMainWindow}\caption{Main window of the data acquisition program.}   \label{FigMuonMainWindow}\end{figure}When you launch {\em muon} you will bring up the main window as shown in Figure \ref{FigMuonMainWindow}.  Within the window are five sections:\begin{itemize}   \item  Control   \item  Muon Decay Time Histogram   \item  Monitor   \item  Rate Meter   \item  Muons Through Detector\end{itemize}\begin{figure}[tbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[width=4in]{MuonLifetime/ConfigurePane}   \caption{Muon's Configure Pane.}   \label{FigConfigurePane}\end{figure}\subsection{Control}Before data collection can begin, the system must be configured to know on which port the data will be received and how it should be histogrammed. Unfortunately these settings are not stored and must to reset with each run.  (At this point, you may better understand the description \emph{basic} that I applied to the program.)By clicking the \emph{Configure} button, one opens the\emph{Configure} pane as shown in Figure \ref{FigConfigurePane}. Select the port, which in our case, since we use USB, is com2.  The program does not properly store this data and sometimes resets the port to com1.  If, during the experiment, you are not receiving data, check that the correct port is selected.Select the range and number of bins in the histogram.  During experimental set-up, good values to choose are 6 $\mu$s and 10 bins.  However, for long data collection runs, choose 20 $\mu$s and 60 bins.  The greater resolution provides a better check on the accuracy of your data.  Close the Configure pane,  the other sections of the pane are not relevant to data acquisition.The \emph{Start} and \emph{Pause/Resume} buttons do exactly what their names imply. The \emph{Fit} button provides a crude fit to the data.  Use this only when the data acqusition is paused, since the collection of new data will erase the fit.  (N.B. The fit routine use in \emph{Muon} has had stability problems.  It's results are not sufficient for your lab report.)The \emph{View Raw Data} button opens a window that allows you todisplay the timing data for a user selected number of events, with themost recent events read in first. Here an event is any signal abovethe discriminator threshold so it includes data from both throughgoing muons as well as signals from muons that stop and decay insidethe detector. Each raw data record contains two fields of information.The first is a time, indicating the year, month, day, hour, minute andsecond, reading left to right, in which the data was recorded. Thesecond field is an integer that encodes two kinds of information. Ifthe integer is less than 40000, it is the time between two successiveflashes, in units of nanoseconds. If the integer is greater than orequal to than 40000, then the units position indicates the number of"time outs," (instances where a second scintillator flash did notoccur within the preset timing window opened by the first flash). Seethe data file format below for more information. Typically, viewingraw data is a diagnostic operation and is not needed for normal datataking.The \emph{Quit} button stops the measurement and asks you whether youwant to save the data. The questions seems rather straightforward, but the resulting action is as couterintuitive as pressing START to shutdown a computer.  Answering \emph{NO} writes the data to a file that isnamed after the date and time the measurement was originally started,i.e., 03-07-13-17-26.data. Answering \emph{YES} appends the data to the filemuon.data. The file muon.data is intended as the main data file.  I recommend performing a test run to see what happens in both cases.  As I prefer having the datafile name include the data, I often answer \emph{NO}.  Others prefer choosing \emph{YES}, then renaming the filename.  \subsubsection{Data File Format}Timing information about each signal above threshold is written to the data file.  The file is in ascii format and can be read by any text editor.  The first data field provides information on the time between sucessive pulses. If that integer is less than 40000, then the value corresponds to the time, to the nearest nanosecond, between successive signals.  If the value is greater than or equal to 40000then the timing circuit exceeded its maximum number of clock cycles before receiving a second signal.  The circuit \emph{timed-out}.  The number in the units place indicates the number of times the circuit timed-out before receiving a signal.  For example, 40005 corresponds to a circuit that was triggered but then timed-out 5 times before a subsequent signal arrived.  The second field is the computer time in seconds.  This value is typically the number of seconds since  1 January 1970, a date convention used in C and in Unix. \subsection{Monitor} This panel shows rate-related information for the current measurement.The elapsed time of the current measurement is shown along with theaccumulated number of times from the start of the measurement that thereadout electronics was triggered (Number of muons). The Muon Rate isthe number of times the readout electronics was triggered in theprevious second. The number of pairs of successive signals, where thetime interval between successive signals is less than the maximumnumber of clock cycles of the timing circuit, is labeled Muon Decays,even though some of these events may be background events and not realmuon decays. Finally, the number of muon decays per minute isdisplayed as Decay Rate.\subsection{Rate Meter} This continuously updated graph plots the number of signals abovediscriminator threshold versus time. It is useful for monitoring theoverall trigger rate.\subsection{Muons through Detector}This graph shows the time history of the number of signals abovethreshold. Its time scale is automatically adjusted and is intended toshow time scales much longer than the rate meter. This graph is usefulfor long term monitoring of the trigger rate. Strictly speaking, itincludes signals from not only through going muons but any source thatmight produce a trigger. The horizontal axis is time, indicated downto the second. The scale is sliding so that the far left-hand sidealways corresponds to the start of the measurement session. The binwidth is indicated in the upper left-hand portion of the plot.\subsection{Muon Decay Time Histogram}This plot is probably the most interesting one. It is a histogram ofthe time difference between successive triggers and is the plot usedto measure the muon lifetime. The horizontal scale is the timedifference between successive triggers in units of microseconds. Itsmaximum displayed value is set by the \emph{Configure} menu. (All timedifferences less than 20 $\mu$sec are entered into the histogram butmay not actually be displayed due to menu choices.) You can also setthe number of horizontal bins using the same menu. The vertical scaleis the number of times this time difference occurred and is adjustedautomatically as data is accumulated. A button (\emph{Change y scaleLinear/Log}) allows you to plot the data in either a linear-linear orlog-linear fashion. The horizontal error bars for the data points spanthe width of each timing bin and the vertical error bars are thesquare root of the number of entries for each bin. The upper righthand portion of the plot shows the number of data points in thehistogram. Again, due to menu selections not all points may bedisplayed. If you haveselected the \emph{Fit} button then information about the fit to thedata is displayed. The muon lifetime is returned, assuming muon decaytimes are exponentially distributed, along with the chi-squared perdegree of freedom ratio, a standard measure of the quality of the fit.(See Bevington for more details.) A \emph{Screen capture} button allows you to produce a plot of the display.Select the button and then open the \emph{Paint} utility (in Windows) andpaste the graphic into a blank document window.\section{Procedure}\subsection{Getting Started}The black aluminum cylinder (“detector”) is placed in the wooden pedestal for convenience; it will work in any orientation. Connect the power cable and signal cable between the electronics box and the detector. Connect the USB cable between the back of the electronics box and the PC.  If USB is not available then use the serial cable. \textbf{DO NOT USE BOTH.}Turn on power to the electronics box. The red LED indicates that the power is on.  The green LED indicates an event in the PMT.  Set the HV between  –1100 and –1200 Volts using the knob at the top of the detector tube. The exact setting is not critical and the voltage can be monitored by using the multimeter probe connectors at the top of the detector tube. If you are curious, you can look directly at the output of the PMTusing the \emph{PMT Output} on the detector tube and an oscilloscope.(A digital scope works best.) \textbf{Be certain to terminate thescope input at 50 }$\mathbf{\Omega}$\textbf{ or you signal will bedistorted}. You should see a signal that looks like Figure \ref{FigPMTOutput}. Thefigure shows details like scope settings and trigger levels.Connect the BNC cable between \emph{PMT Output} on the detector and\emph{PMT Input} on the box. Adjust the discriminator setting on theelectronics box so that it is in the range 180--220 mV. The green LEDon the box front panel should now be flashing.You can look at the amplifier output by using the \emph{AmplifierOutput} on the box front panel and an oscilloscope. The scope inputimpedance must be 50 $\Omega$. Similarly, you can examine the outputof the discriminator using the \emph{Discriminator Output} connector.Again, the scope needs to be terminated at 50 $\Omega$. Figure\ref{FigAmpOutput} shows typical signals for both the amplifier anddiscriminator outputs on the same plot. Details about scope timesettings and trigger thresholds are on the plot.Launch the program \emph{Muon} which is located on the desktop of the PC.  Configure the program using the \emph{Configure} button to set the data port and the histogram dimensions.Click on \emph{Start}. You should see the rate meter at the lower left-hand side of your computer screen immediately start to display the raw trigger rate for events that trigger the readout electronics. The mean rate should be about 6 Hz or so.\subsection{Lab Exercises}\begin{enumerate}   \item  Measure the gain of the 2-stage amplifier using a sine wave.     Apply a 100kHz 100mV peak-to-peak sine wave to the input of the electronics box input. Measure the amplifier output and take the ratio Vout/Vin.     Increase the frequency. How good is the frequency response of the amp? Estimate the maximum decay rate you could observe with the instrument.   \item  Measure the saturation output voltage of the amp.    Increase the magnitude of the input sine wave and monitor the amplifier output.   Does a saturated amp output change the timing of the FPGA? What are the implications for the size of the light signals from the scintillator?    \item  Examine the behavior of the discriminator by feeding a sine wave to the box input and adjusting the discriminator threshold. Monitor the discriminator output and describe its shape.   \item  Measure the timing properties of the FPGA:    \begin{enumerate}\item Using the pulser on the detector, measure the time betweensuccessive rising edges on an oscilloscope. Compare this number withthe number from software display.         \item  Measure the linearity of the FPGA:       Alter the time between rising edges and plot scope results v. FPGA results;       Can use time between 1 $\mu$s and 20 $\mu$s in steps of 2 $\mu$s.          \item   Determine the timeout interval of the FPGA by gradually increasing the time between successive rising edges of a double-pulse and determine when the FPGA no longer records results. What does this imply about the maximum time between signal pulses?          \item  Decrease the time interval between successive pulses and try to determine/bound the FPGA internal timing bin width.   What does this imply about the binning of the data? What does this imply about the minimum decay time you can observe?   \end{enumerate}    \item  Adjust (or misadjust) discriminator threshold. Increase the discriminator output rate as measured by the scope or some other means. Observe the raw muon count rate and the spectrum of "decay" times. (This exercise needs a digital scope and some patience since the counting rate is “slowish.”)   \item  What HV should you run at? Adjust/misadjust HV and observe amp output. (We know that good signals need to be at about 200 mV or so before discriminator, so set discriminator before hand.) With fixed threshold, alter the HV and watch raw muon count rate and decay spectrum. \item Connect the output of the detector can to the input of theelectronics box. Look at the amplifier output using a scope. (Adigital scope works best.) Be sure that the scope input is terminatedat 50 $\Omega$. What do you see? Now examine the discriminator outputsimultaneously. Again, be certain to terminate the scope input at 50 $\Omega$.What do you see?   \item   Set up the instrument for a muon lifetime measurement.    Start and observe the decay time spectrum.    The muons whose decays we observe are born outside the detector and therefore spend some (unknown) portion of their lifetime outside the detector. So, we never measure the actual lifetime of any muon. Yet, we claim we are measuring the lifetime of muons. How can this be?   \item Write a MatLab routine to fit the decay time histogram and    the background.   \item   From your measurement of the muon lifetime and a value of the muon mass from some trusted source, calculate the value of Fermi coupling constant $G_{F}$. Compare your value with that from a trusted source.   \item Using the approach outlined in the text, measure the charge   ratio $\rho$ of positive to negative muons at ground level or at   some other altitude.   \end{enumerate}\endinput
