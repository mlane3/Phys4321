Abstract: We compare two physical systems: polarization degrees of freedom of a macroscopic light beam and the Josephson junction (JJ) in the "charge qubit regime". The first system obviously cannot carry genuine quantum information and we show that the maximal entanglement which could be encoded into polarization of two light beams scales like 1/(photon number). Two theories of JJ, one leading to the picture of "JJ-qubit" and the other based on the mean-field approach are discussed. The later, which seems to be more appropriate, implies that the JJ system is, essentially, mathematically equivalent to the polarization of a light beam with the number of photons replaced by the number of Cooper pairs. The existing experiments consistent with the "JJ-qubit" picture and the theoretical arguments supporting, on the contrary, the classical model are briefly discussed. The Franck-Hertz-type experiment is suggested as an ultimate test of the JJ nature.

Abstract: The gastric and antiulcer effects of UP 5145-52, a new naphthyridinone derivative (1-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-1,8-naphthyridin-3-yl)-4-acetoxy butane, were studied in rats.  UP 5145-52 dose dependently prevented the formation of gastric lesions induced by a necrotizing agent such as absolute ethanol, indomethacin or stress (ED50 values were 0.065, 1.26 and 0.72 mg/kg p.o., respectively).  A beneficial action was also observed against indomethacin-induced intestinal lesions.  UP 5145-52 inhibited total acid output in the pylorus-ligated rat (ED50 on total acid output was 0.16 mg/kg p.o.) and in the rat chronic gastric fistula model.  The mechanism of antisecretory activity currently remains unknown as UP 5145-52 fails to bind to receptors involved in gastric secretion (H-2 or muscarinic) and to inhibit H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase.  The ability of UP 5145-52 (1 mg/kg p.o.) to restore synthesis of gastric acid glycoproteins depressed by previous administration of absolute ethanol suggests that cytoprotection could play a role in the antiulcer efficacy of the drug.

Abstract: An investigation of the spatial relaxation of the electrons and benchmark calculations of spatially resolved non-conservative electron transport in model gases has been carried out using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. The Monte Carlo code has been specifically developed to study the spatial relaxation of electrons in an idealized steady-state Townsend (SST) experiment in the presence of non-conservative collisions. Calculations have been performed for electron transport properties with the aim of providing the benchmark required to verify the codes used in plasma modelling. Both the spatially uniform values and the relaxation profiles of the electron transport properties may serve as an accurate test for such codes. The explicit effects of ionization and attachment on the spatial relaxation profiles are considered using physical arguments. We identify the relations for the conversion of hydrodynamic transport properties to those found in the SST experiment. Our Monte Carlo simulation code and sampling techniques appropriate to these experiments have provided us with a way to test these conversion formulae and their convergence.

Abstract: Novel N-6-(indol-3-yl)alkyl derivatives of adenosine were synthesized. The adenosine receptor affinity and the antinociceptive activity of these compounds were assessed in binding studies and the phenylbenzoquinone-induced writhing test. Most of these analogues exhibited a potent analgesic activity without side effects. Among them, compound 3c (UP 202-32) bound to A(1) (K-i = 110 nM) and A(2) (K-i = 350 nM) adenosine receptors in a specific manner since it did not interact with many other receptors,especially opioid binding sites. The antinociceptive activity in the phenylbenzoquinone assay (ED(50) = 3.3 mg/kg po) was antagonized by 8-cyclopentyl-theophylline, suggesting that an adenosinergic mechanism underlies the analgesic activity observed with this compound. The data obtained with these new N-6-substituted adenosine receptor agonists emphasize the interest of such compounds in the treatment of pain.

Abstract: In this work we exhibit a new criterion for ergodicity of diffeomorphisms involving conditions on Lyapunov exponents and the general position of some invariant manifolds. On the one hand, we derive uniqueness of SRB-measures for transitive surface diffeomorphisms. On the other hand, using recent results on the existence of blenders we give a positive answer, in the C-1 topology, to a conjecture of Pugh and Shub in the context of partially hyperbolic conservative diffeomorphisms with two dimensional center bundle.

Abstract: In this work we obtain a new criterion to establish ergodicity and nonuniform hyperbolicity of smooth measures of diffeomorphisms of closed connected Riemannian manifolds. This method allows us to give a more accurate description of certain ergodic components. The use of this criterion in combination with topological devices such as blenders lets us obtain global ergodicity and abundance of nonzero Lyapunov exponents in some contexts.
In the partial hyperbolicity context, we obtain that stably ergodic diffeomorphisms are C(1)-dense among volume-preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with 2-dimensional center bundle. This is motivated by a well-known conjecture of Pugh and Shub.

Abstract: We obtain the following dichotomy for accessible partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms of three-dimensional manifolds having compact center leaves: either there is a unique entropy-maximizing measure, this measure has the Bernoulli property and its center Lyapunov exponent is 0, or there are a finite number of entropy-maximizing measures, all of them with non-zero center Lyapunov exponents (at least one with a negative exponent and one with a positive exponent), that are finite extensions of a Bernoulli system. In the first case of the dichotomy, we obtain that the system is topologically conjugated to a rotation extension of a hyperbolic system. This implies that the second case of the dichotomy holds for an open and dense set of diffeomorphisms in the hypothesis of our result. As a consequence, we obtain an open set of topologically mixing diffeomorphisms having more than one entropy-maximizing measure.

Abstract: In this paper we will prove some results about integrability of the weak invariant bundles for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in dimension 3. We deal with the problems of existence and uniqueness in case we have transitivity and denseness of periodic orbits. We prove that if we have two crossing central curves contained in a weak-unstable disk then E-cu is uniquely integrable. We also obtain the integrability of the center bundle if the compact periodic center curves are dense.

Abstract: Auditory/verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are comprised of spoken conversational speech seeming to arise from specific, nonself speakers. One hertz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) reduces excitability in the brain region stimulated. Studies utilizing 1-Hz rTMS delivered to the left temporoparietal cortex, a brain area critical to speech perception, have demonstrated statistically significant improvements in AVHs relative to sham simulation. A novel mechanism of AVHs is proposed whereby dramatic pre-psychotic social withdrawal prompts neuroplastic reorganization by the "social brain" to produce spurious social meaning via hallucinations of conversational speech. Preliminary evidence supporting this hypothesis includes a very high rate of social withdrawal emerging prior to the onset of frank psychosis in patients who develop schizophrenia and AVHs. Moreover, reduced AVHs elicited by temporoparietal 1-Hz rTMS are likely to reflect enhanced long-term depression. Some evidence suggests a loss of long-term depression following experimentally-induced deafferentation. Finally, abnormal cortico-cortical coupling is associated with AVHs and also is a common outcome of deafferentation.
Auditory/verbal hallucinations (AVHs) of spoken speech or "voices" are reported by 60-80% of persons with schizophrenia at various times during the course of illness.(1-2) AVHs are associated with high levels of distress,(3-5) functional disability,(6) and can lead to violent acts.(7,8) Among patients with AVHs, these symptoms remain poorly or incompletely responsive to currently available treatments in approximately 25% of cases.' For patients with AVHs who do respond to antipsychotic drugs, there is a very high likelihood that these experiences will recur in subsequent episodes.(10) A more precise characterization of underlying pathophysiology may lead to more efficacious treatments.

Abstract: Background: An appropriate diet is essential to avoid complications of overfeeding or underfeeding in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The paucity of consistent comparative data on energy expenditure for each ventilation mode complicates diet prescription. This study evaluates caloric requirements by comparing estimated and measured energy expenditure values for 2 ventilation modes. Methods: The energy expenditure of 100 ICU patients on assisted or controlled mechanical ventilation was measured by indirect calorimetry for 20 minutes. Values were calculated for a 24-hour period and compared with Harris-Benedict estimates multiplied by an injury factor and either multiplied or not by a 10% activity factor. Results: The mean Harris-Benedict estimate was 1858.87 +/- 488.67 kcal/24 h when multiplied by an injury factor and a 10% activity factor. The mean energy expenditure values measured by indirect calorimetry were 1712.76 +/- 491.95 kcal/24 h for controlled and 1867.33 +/- 542.67 kcal/24 h for assisted ventilation. The mean total energy expenditure for assisted ventilation was 10.71% greater than the mean for controlled ventilation (P <.001). For controlled ventilation, Harris-Benedict results overestimated indirect calorimetry values by 141.10 +/- 10 kcal/24 h (8.2%, P =.012) when multiplied by injury and activity factors, and underestimated values by 44.28 +/- 28 kcal/24 h (2.6%, P =.399) when the equation was calculated without the activity factor. For assisted ventilation, Harris-Benedict results underestimated indirect calorimetry values by 198.84 +/- 84 kcal/24 h (10.7%, P =.001) when not multiplied by the activity factor and by 13.46 kcal/24 h (0.75%) when the activity factor was used, but differences were not statistically significant (P =.829). Conclusions: Results suggest that a 10% activity factor should be adopted only for assisted ventilation because multiplication by an activity factor may lead to overfeeding of patients on controlled ventilation.

Abstract: I observe that quantum physics emerged at the turn of the last century when physics had shifted its concern from propagation phenomena to questions of structure. This transition materialized with the development of a new experimental technique, the bombardment method. The transition is well exemplified by the move from the experimental studies of Heinrich Hertz to those of Ernest Rutherford, and from those of Heinrich Hertz and Philipp Lenard to those of James Franck and Gustav Hertz. I trace the history of Rutherford's experimental bombardment method as it emerged from nineteenth-century propagation studies. I then demonstrate the use of the bombardment method in another experimental context, namely, in the celebrated experiment of Franck and Hertz. I locate the root of this experiment in Lenard's experimental studies and analyze Franck and Hertz's flawed interpretation of it. I conclude by underlining the crucial role that Bohr's quantum theory of the atom played in helping to establish these bombardment experiments as milestones of modern physics.

Abstract: The seminal experiment of Franck and Hertz [1], which helped lay the foundations of quantum and atomic physics, is investigated in the light of recent developments in the kinetic theory of swarms of charged particles in neutral gases. We solve the Boltzmann equation using both eigenfunction expansion methods and spatial finite difference techniques, for electrons in both a model gas and in mercury, the gas originally used by Franck and Hertz. We consider the effect of elastic collisions in particular. The periodic spatial structures encountered in the Franck-Hertz experiment have a physical origin similar to the oscillatory phenomena observed by Fletcher [5] in low pressure, low current discharges, and by Winkler ct al [12-14] and other contemporary authors in simulations of low temperature plasmas.

Abstract: In reference (Robson R E, Li B and White R D 2000 J Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 33 507), we revisited the Franck-Hertz experiment, and gave solutions of the Boltzmann equation describing the spatially-resolved relaxation profiles of a non-hydrodynamic swarm of electrons streaming at a steady rate from a plane source into mercury vapour. In this paper, we extend this study to other cases and develop a formalism for both ions and electrons and consider situations where both conservative and non-conservative collisions may take place. As in Robson et al (2000), we employ a 'two-temperature' Burnett function representation of operators in velocity space in the Boltzmann equation. Configuration space is represented by a finite mesh of points and a finite difference technique is developed accordingly. Boundary conditions are specified for the general problem and techniques for solving the resulting large system of algebraic equations are discussed. The importance of a 'multi-term' analysis and the existence of negative differential conductivity (NDC) under non-hydrodynamic conditions is displayed by considering electrons in methane. The explicit effect of ionization on the spatial relaxation profiles is considered along with a study on the importance of treating ionization as a true non-conservative process as opposed to another inelastic process. The spatial relaxation profiles are compared with predictions from eigenvalue theory.

Abstract: The spatial transition behaviour of the electron gas on its way from a uniform active plasma through an adjacent region of field decay and reversal into a field-free remote plasma is studied in neon on a nonlocal kinetic basis by solving the appropriate electron Boltzmann equation and by performing complementary Monte Carlo simulations. The main objective of the analysis concerns the complex features of the electron gas in its transition process from a field-driven active plasma, through a range of partial electron trapping in a potential energy valley to a diffusion-driven remote plasma. In this context especially the influence of the electron trapping and of the extent and depth of the potential valley is elaborated. In addition to the macroscopic characterization by means of the important transport and dissipation properties of the electrons their energy space resolved behaviour is derived and interpreted. A distinct decoupling between the spatial evolution of the isotropic and anisotropic part of the velocity distribution function and complex structures in the anisotropic part have been found. These findings could be clearly confirmed by the almost perfect coincidence with corresponding results obtained by the MC simulations.

Abstract: A brief overview of previously obtained and novel data on the manifestations of an analogue of Franck-Hertz effect in photo- and cathodoluminescence of wide-gap inorganic materials is presented. On the example of NaCl:Tl(+) and MgO:Cr(3+) single crystals, the excitation processes of the luminescence of 6s(2) Tl(+) ions and 3d(3) Cr(3+) ions by 5-15 keV electrons or 5-20 eV photons at 6-420 K have been studied. The rapid processes of the direct energy transfer to Tl(+) by hot conduction electrons or to Cr(3+) centers by hot electrons and/or hot valence holes have been separated from rapid excitonic and more inertial electron-hole processes.

Abstract: In the wide-gap metal oxides, with E, lower than the formation energy of a pair of Frenkel defects, hot recombination of nonrelaxed electrons and holes cause the creation of defects under the conditions of high-density excitation. Novel manifestations of the fast direct energy transfer by hot electrons to impurity centers (e.g., in Al(2)O(3) center dot Sc(3+) and Al(2)O(3)center dot Gd(3+)) or to intrinsic defects (F and F(+) centers induced by the previous irradiation of Al(2)O(3) With Swift heavy ions) have been revealed using the methods of low-temperature cathodo- and photoluminescence. The contribution of the solid-state analogue of the Franck-Hertz effect as well as of the multiplication processes of electronic excitations to the suppression of [lot recombination and the increase of radiation resistance of dielectrics has been analysed.

Abstract: Aims To investigate the ability of spectral features of signal-averaged body-surface potential maps in identifying post-infarction patients who are at risk of developing ventricular tachycardia.
Methods and Results We recorded 120 lead body surface potential maps during sinus rhythm in 135 subjects (45 patients with healed myocardial infarction but no history of venticular tachycardia, 45 patients with both healed myocardial infarction and at least one episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia, and 45 normal subjects) and analysed spectral features of body surface potential maps selected on the basis of isoharmonic maps for given bands of the frequency spectrum. We found that in the low-frequency band (1-11 Hertz), the group-mean power spectra of leads located at isoharmonic map maxima were significantly different (P<0.0001) between the two groups of myocardial infarction patients. We estimated that this single feature alone can prospectively identify myocardial infarction patients at risk for ventricular tachycardia with a predictive accuracy of 74 +/- 6%.
Conclusion Our results suggest that the bulk of diagnostic information associated with arrhythmogenicity resides in the low-frequency band of the power spectrum. This finding is at variance with the established notion that only the high-frequency component of signal-averaged electrocardiograms carries such information.

Abstract: A classic experiment, where a four-electrode Franck-Hertz tube is used to show various energy states (critical potentials) to which a neutral mercury atom can be raised by electron impact, is upgraded and elucidated thanks to a novel arrangement of applied inter-electrode potentials. By that means, a suitably located plasma region, the working field-free scattering chamber, can be created dynamically and maintained thereafter under appropriate conditions of cathode emission current and mercury vapour pressure. Concurrently, a more efficient mechanism for displaying excitation peaks becomes operant in the adjoining electron collection cell, by means of the window for slow-electron transmission that is available in mercury below the resonance peak in the cross section at about 0.4 eV. The resultant enhanced resolution in current-voltage curves permits the identification and measurement within 0.05 eV of the leading features in the known electron impact excitation spectrum of mercury.

Abstract: The alternative version of the Franck-Hertz experiment with mercury, in which a two-grid tube is used as a combination of electron gun, equipotential collision space and detection cell, was analysed recently in considerable detail. In particular, it was inferred that, at optimal pressure, the formation of peaks in the anode current at inelastic thresholds is mediated inside the detection cell by the large variation, a maximum at 0.4 eV, in the cross section for elastic scattering. This variation is due to a shape resonance in the electron-mercury system and is observable persuasively at the onset of anode current as a sharp peak followed by a clear minimum. In this paper, the passage of electrons through the second grid to the anode region is analysed in terms of kinetic theory. The discussion is based on a simplified expression for the electron current derivable from an approximate form of the Boltzmann transport equation that maintains the spatial density gradient but omits elastic energy losses. The estimated range of pressure underlying this kind of idealization is in good agreement with experiment. An explicit solution is obtained by constructing an analytic expression for the momentum transfer cross section of mercury using a recent theory of generalized Fano profiles for overlapping resonances. This solution is used in order to model successfully the formation of peaks at the threshold of anode current and at excitation potentials, and to explain the dependence of the observed profiles on the pressure and on the sign and magnitude of the potential across the detection cell.

Abstract: A model is developed which explains the collective plasma phenomena associated with the extended Franck-Hertz experiment described in an earlier paper by Nicoletopoulos [Eur. J. Phys. 23, 533 (2002). The particular focus is on the formation of the free steady-state monotonic double layer. The approach used is a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal theory in which one postulates the space potential and a suitable multicomponent electron distribution and uses Poisson's equation to solve for a physically meaningful ion distribution. A key feature is that the input space potential is chosen with a spatial scale much larger than the electron Debye length, with a restricting condition derivable from the prescribed form of volume production of positive ions. The model provides good quantitative agreement with the experimental results for mercury vapor, and can provide sufficient and necessary conditions for double layer formation in other atomic gases in similar experimental arrangements.

Abstract: Periodic electron spatial structures in gases occur within a window of voltages and pressures. Recent accurate solutions of Boltzmann's equation portray this effect, but offer little physical insight into the causes of windowing. Here we show for the first time how such insight can be obtained using the fluid model established by Robson, White, and Petrovic [Rev. Mod. Phys. 77, 1303 (2005)], with an appropriate generalization of the heat flux ansatz. Conversely, the success in portraying windowing itself becomes a stringent test of the integrity of this fluid model, which can then be applied to a wider range of problems.

Abstract: The physically based, benchmarked fluid model developed by Robson et al. [R. E. Robson, R. D. White, and Z. Lj. Petrovic, Rev. Mod. Phys. 77, 1303 (2005)] and extended to analyze electron swarms in a spatially homogeneous electric field under conditions corresponding to the Franck-Hertz experiment [P. Nicoletopoulos and R. E. Robson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 124502 (2008)] is generalized to investigate the nonlocal response and resonance phenomena associated with electrons subject to an externally prescribed, spatially varying electrostatic field. Analytic expressions are first derived for the mean velocity, energy, and heat flux of electrons in a harmonically varying field, and expressions are then given for fields with more general spatial dependences. Numerical examples are given for both benchmark model cross sections and a real gas.

Abstract: The fundamental properties of the signal structure in Franck-Hertz experiments are analyzed. The central result is that the spacings between the minima in Franck-Hertz curves are not equidistant but increase linearly with the number of minima. This increase is especially pronounced at low atomic pressure. We suggest that the increase of the spacings is caused by the additional acceleration of electrons over their mean free path after the excitation energy is reached. Our model accurately estimates the lowest excitation energies of mercury (4.67 eV) and neon (16.6 eV) atoms and the mean free path of electrons in standard Franck-Hertz experiments. These results contradict the usual assumption that the spacings between successive minima or maxima are equal. We demonstrate that a standard Franck-Hertz apparatus can be upgraded to do more advanced experiments. (C) 2006 American Association of Physics Teachers.

Abstract: Spatially resolved transport properties of a swarm of charged particles in spatially homogeneous and orthogonal dc electric and magnetic fields are investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. The transient spatial profiles of the density and energy distribution function demonstrate an initial periodic structure of similar physical origin to the Franck-Hertz oscillations. It is found that, independent of the presence of a magnetic field, the spatial density profiles of the swarm relax to a Gaussian profile after a sufficient time.

Abstract: The seminal experiment of Franck and Hertz, which helped lay the foundations of quantum and atomic physics, is investigated through solution of the Boltzmann equation, using both eigenfunction expansion methods and spatial finite-difference techniques. We consider electrons in both a model gas and in mercury, the gas originally used by Franck and Hertz, and focus upon the effects of both inelastic and elastic collisions. It is pointed out that the periodic spatial structures encountered in the Franck-Hertz experiment have a physical origin similar to the oscillatory phenomena observed by Fletcher and others previously in low-pressure, low-current discharges, and by Winkler et al, and other contemporary authors in simulations of low-temperature plasmas.

Abstract: New urea L-phenyl alanine derivatives of 4-aminopyridine have been synthesized and evaluated for analgesic activity with the PBQ writhing test in mice and the Randall-Selitto test in rats. Potent oral activity (ID50 < 10 mg/kg) and good tolerance were found in alkyl, arylalkyl and carboxyalkyl urea derivatives. The analgesic activity was found to be totally dependent on the pyridine moiety and was at least partly inhibited by pretreatment with (alpha) methyltyrosine, as was the case for 4-aminopyridine. These compounds are therefore pharmacologically interesting as new analgesic derivatives of 4-aminopyridine. They have a higher oral activity and a better activity/tolerance profile.

Abstract: The interpretation of the anode current characteristics obtained in the famous Franck-Hertz experiment of 1914 led to the verification of Bohr's predictions of quantised atomic states. This fundamental experiment has been often repeated, and nowadays is generally part of the curriculum in modem physics education. However, the interpretation of the experiment is typically based upon significant simplifying assumptions, some quite unrealistic. This is the case especially in relation to the kinetics of the electron gas, which is in reality quite complex, due mainly to non-uniformities in the electric field, caused by a combination of accelerating and retarding components. This non-uniformity leads to a potential energy valley in which the electrons are trapped. The present state of understanding of such effects, and their influence upon the anode characteristics, is quite unsatisfactory. In this article a rigorous study of a cylindrical Franck-Hertz experiment is presented, using mercury vapour, the aim being to reveal and explain what really happens with the electrons under realistic experimental conditions. In particular, the anode current characteristics are investigated over a range of mercury vapour pressures appropriate to the experiment to clearly elaborate the effects of elastic collisions (ignored in typical discussions) on the power budget, and the trapping of electrons in the potential energy valley.

Abstract: Initial antibiotic therapy is an important determinant of clinical outcomes in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Several studies have investigated this issue, with conflicting results. This study investigated risk factors of inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy and its impact on outcomes for patients with a clinical diagnosis of VAP. The primary outcome was adequacy of antimicrobial therapy. Secondary outcomes were duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) lengths of stay, and mortality due to VAP. Mean age was 62.9 +/- 15.2 years, mean APACHE (Acute Physiological Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score was 20.1 +/- 8.1 and mean MODS (Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score) was 3.7 +/- 2.5. Sixty-nine (45.7%) of 151 patients with a clinical diagnosis of VAP received inadequate antimicrobial treatment for VAP initially. There were 100 (66.2%) episodes of VAP caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens, of which 56% were inadequately treated, whereas the rate of inadequate antimicrobial therapy for VAP caused by susceptible-drug pathogens was 25.5% (P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk of inadequate antimicrobial treatment was more than twice as great for patients with late-onset VAP [odds ratio (OR), 2.93; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30-6.64; P = 0.01], and more than three times for patients with VAP caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.29-7.30; P = 0.01) or with polymicrobial VAP (OR, 3.67; 95% Cl, 1.21-11.12; P = 0.02). Inadequate antimicrobial treatment was associated with higher mortality for patients with VAP. Two of three independent risk factors for treatment inadequacy were associated with the isolation and identification of micro-organisms. (c) 2007 The Hospital Infection Society.

Abstract: Poison gas warfare was initiated in the Great War by a German military unit that included five future Nobel laureates: James Franck, Fritz Haber, Otto Hahn, Gustav Hertz and Walther Nernst. It was Haber's idea to use poison gas. To implement gas warfare he devised an organization that meshed the academy into the military-industrial complex. Later three other Nobel laureates, Emil Fischer, Heinrich Wieland and Richard Willstatter, contributed to the enterprise. Huge quantities of poisons were used by both sides during the war, because they were well adapted to static trench warfare, even though-which is a surprise to many-they were substantially less deadly than explosives.

Abstract: The kinetic theory of charged particles in gases has come a long way in the last 60 years or so, but many of the advances have yet to find their way into contemporary studies of low-temperature plasmas. This review explores the way in which this gap might be bridged, and focuses in particular on the analytic framework and numerical techniques for the solution of Boltzmann's equation for both electrons and ions, as well as on the development of fluid models and semi-empirical formulae. Both hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic regimes are considered and transport properties are calculated in various configurations of dc and ac electric and magnetic fields. We discuss in particular the duality in transport coefficients arising from non-conservative collisions (attachment, ionization).
